# ObjectToJsonObject

Source code: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/test/unit/utils/utils.js)

## Get Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Duplicate the v1 (the poorly written version)
3. Rename to your latest version (e.g. v2)
4. Refactor the code while making sure the tests in the "tests" directory still pass. You can add comments if needed to explain your thought process.
5. If the tests pass and you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request.

## To run the tests

```
npm test
```
