        "### Issues Identified\n\n1. **Global Variable Usage**: The code uses global variables which can lead to conflicts and hard-to-track bugs.\n2. **Magic Numbers**: The code contains several magic numbers (e.g., `6`, `11`, `12`, `50`, `10`) which should be replaced with named constants for better readability and maintainability.\n3. **Long Function**: The `roll` function is quite long and does multiple things. It should be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n4. **Repetitive Code**: The `currentCategory` function has repetitive code that can be simplified.\n5. **Inconsistent Naming**: The function `wasCorrectlyAnswered` contains a typo in the log message (\"corrent\" instead of \"correct\").\n6. **Hardcoded Strings**: Strings like \"Pop\", \"Science\", \"Sports\", and \"Rock\" are hardcoded in multiple places. These should be replaced with constants or an enumeration.\n7. **Inefficient Array Initialization**: Arrays are initialized with a fixed size but are then used as dynamic arrays. This can be optimized.\n8. **Lack of Comments**: The code lacks comments explaining the logic, which makes it harder to understand.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. Replace global variables with class properties.\n2. Replace magic numbers with named constants.\n3. Break down the `roll` function into smaller functions.\n4. Simplify the `currentCategory` function.\n5. Fix the typo in the `wasCorrectlyAnswered` function.\n6. Replace hardcoded strings with constants.\n7. Optimize array initialization.\n8. Add comments to explain the logic.\n\nI will start by addressing the first issue: replacing global variables with class properties.\n\n{\n    \"thought\": \"I will refactor the code to replace global variables with class properties.\",\n    \"action\": \"overwrite_file\",\n    \"tools_input\": {\n        \"filepath\": \"src/game.js\",\n        \"content\": \"exports = typeof window !== \\\"undefined\\\" && window !== null ? window : global;\\n\\nconst Game = function() {\\n  this.players          = new Array();\\n  this.places           = new Array(6);\\n  this.purses           = new Array(6);\\n  this.inPenaltyBox     = new Array(6);\\n\\n  this.popQuestions     = new Array();\\n  this.scienceQuestions = new Array();\\n  this.sportsQuestions  = new Array();\\n  this.rockQuestions    = new Array();\\n\\n  this.currentPlayer    = 0;\\n  this.isGettingOutOfPenaltyBox = false;\\n\\n  this.didPlayerWin = function(){\\n    return !(this.purses[this.currentPlayer] == 6)\\n  };\\n\\n  this.currentCategory = function(){\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 0)\\n      return 'Pop';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 4)\\n      return 'Pop';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 8)\\n      return 'Pop';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 1)\\n      return 'Science';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 5)\\n      return 'Science';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 9)\\n      return 'Science';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 2)\\n      return 'Sports';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 6)\\n      return 'Sports';\\n    if(this.places[this.currentPlayer] == 10)\\n      return 'Sports';\\n    return 'Rock';\\n  };\\n\\n  this.createRockQuestion = function(index){\\n    return \\\"Rock Question \\\"+index;\\n  };\\n\\n  for(var i = 0;
