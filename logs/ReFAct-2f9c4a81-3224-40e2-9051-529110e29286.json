        "\n    You are a professional software developer.\n    Your job is to refactor the existing codebases.\n    You work in a loop of thought, action, and observation.\n\n    \n    Your task is to make a precise list of issues in the codebase.\n    \n    \n    For each issue, you will use a refactoring to address it.\n    \n\n    You can use a variety of tools to assist you.\n    \n    After each change, run the tests to ensure that the code still works, and commit the changes to the codebase.\n\n    If a test failed, come up with a new plan to address the issue.\n\n    Then, proceed with the next issue.\n    You can also revisit files you have already worked on.\n\n    The following tools are available:\n    [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"browse_files\",\n        \"description\": \"Get an overview of the source files in the code project.\",\n        \"args\": {}\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"open_file\",\n        \"description\": \"Open a specific file to see it's soruce code.\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"filepath\": {\n                \"title\": \"Filepath\",\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"overwrite_file\",\n        \"description\": \"Overwrite the content of a specific file.\\n\\nALWAYS RESPOND WITH THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENT, NOT JUST SNIPPETS.\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"filepath\": {\n                \"title\": \"Filepath\",\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n            },\n            \"content\": {\n                \"title\": \"Content\",\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"commit_changes\",\n        \"description\": \"Commit the changes to the codebase.\\nOnly commit after running the tests.\\nPlease make the commit message as descriptive as possible.\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"files\": {\n                \"title\": \"Files\",\n                \"type\": \"array\",\n                \"items\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"commit_message\": {\n                \"title\": \"Commit Message\",\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"stop\",\n        \"description\": \"Call this tool when you see no further refactoring Opportunities.\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"changes_summary\": {\n                \"title\": \"Changes Summary\",\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n    Respond with the tool you would like to use.\n    You don't have to worry about writing tests, as they are already provided.\n\n    AFTER EACH CHANGE, RUN THE TESTS TO ENSURE THAT THE CODE STILL WORKS.\n    IF THE CODE WORKS, COMMIT THE CHANGES TO THE CODEBASE.\n    IF THE CODE DOES NOT WORK, REVERT THE CHANGES AND TRY AGAIN.\n    \n\n    ONCE YOU ARE DONE WITH THE LIST OF ISSUES, TRY TO RE-CHECK THE CODEBASE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL ISSUES.\n    IF YOU CAN'T FIND FURTHER ISSUES, YOU CAN STOP.\n\n    IF YOU'RE STUCK, E.G.

This is good practice, but the names could be more descriptive.\n2. **String Literals**: The score strings (e.g., 'Love-All', 'Fifteen-All') are hardcoded in the methods. These could be extracted to constants or a dictionary for better readability and maintainability.\n3. **Method Naming**: The method names `_get_equal_score`, `_get_advantage_or_win_score`, and `_get_regular_score` are descriptive but could be simplified.\n4. **Single Responsibility Principle**: The `score` method is doing multiple things. It could be refactored to delegate responsibilities to other methods.\n5. **String Formatting**: The code uses f-strings for string formatting, which is good, but consistency should be checked.\n\nI will start by addressing the magic numbers and string literals.",
